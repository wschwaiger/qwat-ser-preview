# Search Enginge Result Preview
This extension for Contao simulates Google's search engine results pages (SERPs). Enter page title, description, and alias of your web page, and this extension will generate a virtual search result listing based on your input.

## How to use?
Go to **Content->Site structure** in your Contao Back-End and edit a page. For **regular** page types you will find a new palette right after **Meta Information**. At first the preview is filled with dummy data. As soon as you edit page alias, title, or description the **title, description, and URL** will update accordingly. The title will be cut of at 70 characters. The description at 160 characters.
